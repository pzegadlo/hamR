### Set of R functions for testing and calibrating Heterogeneous Agent Models

**Preliminary version 0.1**

Current state of the project reflects the work financed by the Polish National Science Centre through the Miniatura 5 grant number 2021/05/X/HS4/00748.

It contains the code for two agent models (Brock-Hommes 1998 and Alfarano-Lux-Wagner 2008), two calibration methods (Method of Simulated Moments and Quasi-Maximum Likelihood) and three optimisation approaches (Particle Swarm Optimisation, Filtered Neighbourhoods, Random Search).

Optimisation is assumed to happen on a Linux system and utilizes parallel processing.
